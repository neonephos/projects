## Antitrust Policy Notice

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the
intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable
antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to
meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited
under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in
connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust
Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. If you have questions
about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the
Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove
LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
